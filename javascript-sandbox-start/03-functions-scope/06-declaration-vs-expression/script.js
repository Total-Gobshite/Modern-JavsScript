// --------------------------------------------------

// invoked the same way
// declared differently
// expression is a function assigned to variable
// difference is hoisting

// hoisting is a process of moving function and variable declarations to the top of the file, only function declarations are available before the code is executed
// if you had a call to a function EXPRESSION before it was declared, you would get an error
// if you had a call to a function DECLARATION before it was declared, it would work
